# Dataland Examples

This is a collection of example Dataland modules that can be deployed to your Dataland workspace.
You can learn more about Dataland at <https://docs.dataland.io>.

Example modules include [MySQL sync](https://github.com/dataland-io/dataland-examples/tree/main/mysql-sync), [Postgres sync](https://github.com/dataland-io/dataland-examples/tree/main/postgres-sync), [Stripe sync](https://github.com/dataland-io/dataland-examples/tree/main/stripe-fetch), [Airtable sync](https://github.com/dataland-io/dataland-examples/tree/main/airtable-multi-table-sync), and [Shopify sync](https://github.com/dataland-io/dataland-examples/tree/main/shopify-fetch). The Dataland core team releases new "beta" modules here on a regular basis.

Feel free to fork and remix modules to include your own custom logic.

## Getting started

Follow this [guide to install modules](https://dataland-io.notion.site/Deploying-a-module-via-Dataland-CLI-76f8be34a04149aeaa1ee92563075a61) in this repo.

## Repo structure

Generally speaking, each example lives in its own top-level directory in this repo
and should be fully self-contained within that directory.

There is also some additional tooling to ensure consistency across the examples.
