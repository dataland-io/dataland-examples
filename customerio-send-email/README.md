# Overview

This module allows you to send a transactional email to a user by clicking a button in Dataland.

It comes with an example template for a users table (with `id`, `name`, and `email`), and a button column that initiates the email.

This module requires some tweaking to use the appropriate `transactional_message_id` and the parameters.
